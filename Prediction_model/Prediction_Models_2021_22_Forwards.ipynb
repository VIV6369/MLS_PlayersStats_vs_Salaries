For example, a player who played only one game per season could have one shot on target and score one goal, resulting in a goal_conversion_per of 100%. On paper, this player would be the most efficient forward in the league, but in reality, the sample size is simply not big enough. To avoid such scenarios, we need to increase our sample size. To do so, we will filter out players who have played fewer than 765 minutes per season. 765 minutes is a 25% minimum threshold since the regular season has a total of 3060 regulation minutes (34 x 90)."
