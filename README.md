# MLS_PlayersStats_vs_Salaries
 In this project I collected publicly available data. Players stats from mls.com and players salaries from mlsplayers.org. Combiined it together and created one dataframe . Analysed players statistics and their salary.  Created a model that predicts player salary based purely of their past perfomance.
