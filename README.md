Overview:

In this project I've collected publicly available data of soccer players in Major League Soccer. 
Players stats from mls.com and players salaries from mlsplayers.org 
Combined it together and created one dataset. 
Analysed players statistics and their salary.  
Created a model that predicts player salary based purely of their past perfomance.
